<p align="center">Blockchain Explorer for inspecting and analyzing EVM Chains.</p>

Wadzchain provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchains. This includes Ethereum Mainnet, Ethereum Classic, Optimism, Gnosis Chain and many other **Ethereum testnets, private networks, L2s and sidechains**.

See our [project documentation](https://docs.wadzchain.com/) for detailed information and setup instructions.

## About Wadzchain

Wadzchain allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, verify and interact with smart contracts and view and interact with applications on the Ethereum network including many forks, sidechains, L2s and testnets.

Wadzchain is an open-source alternative to centralized, closed source block explorers such as Etherscan, Etherchain and others. As Ethereum sidechains and L2s continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate all transactions.
